# 📸 Project Pages & Screenshots
Below are the key pages of this capstone project, including their routes and what I learned building them.

## 📍 First Page – Props in React
- Route: http://localhost:3000/firstpage
- This page was built using props, which allow data to be passed from parent to child components. It's part of the Data-Driven section in the course and helped me understand how to make reusable components.
